      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>This Recipe website was made by a student that attended UofSC. He was tired of eating campus food and decided to take on cooking. He was always confused on what to make so he decided to work on this website that he uses everyday in his life to deal with the food making confusion. The website was founded on May 2024 in the city of Columbia, SC.</p>
